# Setup 
It is strongly suggested to create a virtual environment to run this project:
```sh
python<version> -m venv .venv
```
The newly created virtual environment should then be activated:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```
And the requirements should be installed:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
